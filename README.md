# First REST-API 
## Annotations 
* Using `Postman` to test the resources. 
	* Headers, key and value must be: 
		* Content-Type and application/json 
	* Body must be raw 
* The empty file `__init__.py` inside directory `./resoures/` serves to say that this directory now it's a module of the program.
